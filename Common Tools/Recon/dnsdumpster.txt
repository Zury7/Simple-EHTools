# ===================== DNSDUMPSTER =====================

# Note: DNSDumpster has a web interface, but this uses a Python API wrapper (e.g., dnsdumpster.py)

# Basic usage with Python wrapper to enumerate DNS records for a domain
python3 dnsdumpster.py example.com

# Save the output to a file
python3 dnsdumpster.py example.com > dnsdumpster_output.txt

# If using requests + BeautifulSoup based scripts, ensure captcha handling is coded or use API if available
# Web: https://dnsdumpster.com (manually paste the domain and download results)
